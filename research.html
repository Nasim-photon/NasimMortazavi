                    <p>Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and sharp wave ripples (SWRs) are distinct neurophysiological events in epilepsy patients. IEDs are biomarkers for seizure detection, while SWRs are physiological events (Mortazavi et al., 2021). Discriminating between these events is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. IEDs typically occur in the 25-75 Hz range, while SWRs are found in the 80-170 Hz range (Mortazavi et al., 2021). Fast ripples (250-500 Hz) are more closely associated with the seizure onset zone than ripples (80-200 Hz) (Urrestarazu et al., 2007). Wavelet analysis of intracerebral EEG can help distinguish preictal and interictal states (Gadhoumi et al., 2012). Importantly, IEDs may be present in scalp EEG even when not visually identifiable, and automated detection algorithms can be developed to recognize these events (Spyrou et al., 2016). These findings contribute to improved understanding and detection of epileptic activity in both intracranial and scalp EEG recordings.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p>Sharp wave ripples (SWRs) in the hippocampus play a crucial role in memory processes and spatial navigation. During associative learning and virtual navigation tasks, SWRs occur when learned task contingencies are unexpectedly altered, suggesting their involvement in flexible learning (McIntosh et al., 2020). SWRs are essential for consolidating spatial, episodic, and social memories in various hippocampal-cortical pathways (Xie et al., 2023). In humans, hippocampal SWRs are linked to visual episodic recollection, with increased SWR rates preceding successful recall and associated with the reactivation of cortical representations (Norman et al., 2019). Furthermore, SWRs during learning contribute to the stabilization of hippocampal spatial maps. Disrupting neuronal activity during SWRs affects spatial representation, leading to remapping of place fields and preventing the refinement of hippocampal maps (Roux et al., 2017). These findings highlight the importance of SWRs in memory formation, consolidation, and retrieval processes.</p>
