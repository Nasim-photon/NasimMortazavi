        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>[I'm a PhD candidate at the Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario, funded by the CIHR Doctoral Fellowship. My research, under the guidance of Dr. Julio Martinez-Trujillo and Dr. Ana Suller Marti, focuses on understanding the dynamics of human learning through sEEG LFP data analysis. My goal is to uncover insights into how neural mechanisms drive learning processes in the brain.

I hold an MSc in Physics with a specialization in effective connectivity, where I utilized Multivariate Granger Causality to explore brain connectivity using fMRI. Additionally, I completed my first MSc in theoretical particle physics in Iran. My academic journey has given me a multidisciplinary approach to neuroscience, combining computational techniques and theoretical models to advance methods for studying human learning.]</p>
